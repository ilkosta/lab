some script that I found useful.

transcript2vlc.js
-----------------

By using [this bookmarklet](javascript:(function(\){if(window.myBookmarklet!==undefined\){myBookmarklet(\);}else{document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script'\)\).src='file:///home/costa/lav/scraping/lynda.com/test.js?';}}\)(\);) you can download the subtitles for vlc from the lynda.com page.
When you are visiting a course page in [lynda.com](http://lynda.com), you can go to the transcript-tab and click on the bookmark to download the vlc file.
